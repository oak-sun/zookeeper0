<p>Let's suppose you want to create a simple programming language to use it together with Kotlin.</p>
<p>In this language, the name of a variable can only start with a lowercase Latin letter like <code class="java">'a'</code>, <code class="java">'b'</code>, <code class="java">'z'</code>, and so on. The following characters can be digits, lower and uppercase Latin letters, and even the underscore character <code class="java">_</code>. Note that a name always needs to have at least one character.</p>
<p>Select all suitable regular expressions that match valid variable names.</p>
